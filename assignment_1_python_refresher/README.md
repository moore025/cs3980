# Assignment 1: Python Refresher
  The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with coding in Python using VSCode, committing changes to git, and refresh skills in installing libraries.
There are three total steps to this assignment. Step 0 (omitted): Create a GitHub repository. If you are reading this now, then this means this step was successfully completed.
Step 1: Python Programming Basics. This step instructs the creation of a Python script echo.py that implements a method to take a user-defined string input
and return a string that resembles the input being echoed similar to if one were to shout on top of a mountain. To implement this, I created a function called echo() that takes
in two inputs: The string to echo and the number of times to echo which has a default value of 3 times. Then, my function truncates the input string such that only the last few characters remain.
The exact length is determined by the number of times the string is to be echoed or repeated. Then, my function prints this truncated string on a new line, then truncates the string again by one letter
and repeats this until the end of the string to which it prints one more line of a single period to signify the echo effect is finished. See the image below for an example when "Hello" is used as the input string to echo.
