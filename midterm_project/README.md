# Midterm Project
I made an Iowa City restaurant reviewer web app that allows for users to share their own personal reviews on local restaurants. Each review requires the restaurant name, a rating out of 10, and a review description. This app was an expansion upon our in-class demo Todo App, and I added functionality to share and update ratings as well as redesigning the interface.

## Necessary Packages and Languages
For this project, I mainly used the Uvicorn and FastAPI packages in order to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for users of the webpage to be able to submit, update, and delete reviews. For languages, I coded the backend in Python, and for the backend I utilized HTML and css to design the interface as well Javascript to handle changes to the webpage contents.

## Usage
